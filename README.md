## :package: Installation
* You add a Google Sheet to your drive.
* Go to Apps Script and paste the code inside of ``Code.gs``.
* Then publish the web app
  * Navigate to Publish -> Deploy as web appâ€¦ on the Apps Scripts tab
  * Set that anyone has access to the app so you will prevent asking for login everytime
  * You get a URL and this URL is your API Interface
* After that you can test your API Interface via [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
